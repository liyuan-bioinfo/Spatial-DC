Spatial-DC (**S**patial-**D**igital **C**ytometry) is a robust deep learning-based method for deconvolution of spatial proteomics, involving infers cell-type composition in each spot and reconstructs spatially and cell-type resolved proteomic profiles. We achieve this by utilizing transfer learning and self-supervised learning with graph convolutional networks (GCN), which enables the incorporation of target spatial proteomics with reference single-cell or single-cell-type proteomics data.
