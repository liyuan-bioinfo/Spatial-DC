## Spatial-DC
![iDEA\_pipeline](workflow.jpg)
To enhance the utility of spatial proteomics data, we propose Spatial-DC (Spatial Digital Cytometry), a deep learning-based framework that infers cell-type composition in each spot and reconstructs spatially and cell-type resolved proteomic profiles. We achieve this by utilizing transfer learning and self-supervised learning with graph convolutional networks (GCN), which enables the incorporation of target spatial proteomics with reference single-cell or single-cell-type proteomics data.
